# JamRadar

A self-hosted, music blog aggregator

# Why?

For the last couple of years i've been obsessed with music recommendations. Spotify recommendations
works great, but it tends to get repeative after some time (because computers). [Hype machine](https://hypem.com/)
is a great way for getting new music, trough actual people that writes blogs.

This wont be (probably) as complete as [Hype machine](https://hypem.com/), but will enable you to pick your own
blogs to aggregate.
